[ORGANIZATION], could you tell the [ORGANIZATION] in what capacity 
you were working [DATE]? 
A.
In undercover plain clothes capacity with Eighth 
[ORGANIZATION].
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
I tender the witness, Judge.  
- CROSS-EXAMINATION -

Yes.

I will permit it.  I will overrule.  
Would it refresh your recollection, 
Officer, if you reviewed the police report?
THE WITNESS:  
Sure, I will take a look.
Yes.  In the report it says that I 
notified him he was under arrest, and read 
him his rights per Miranda, and arrested him. 
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
I have no further questions.  Thank you. 
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
The [ORGANIZATION] has no Redirect.

The [ORGANIZATION] has no further witnesses.  
Judge, at this time we would offer, file and 
introduce S-1 -- for motion purposes only -- 
S-1, which is a copy of the crime lab in this 
matter showing that the evidence confiscated 
from the defendant, both the hand-rolled 
cigar and the nine plastic baggies were each 
positive for marijuana; and [ORGANIZATION], a copy of 
the defendant's prior conviction.
THE COURT:
Any objection for motion purposes?  
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
Not for motion purposes.  
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
With that, Judge, the [ORGANIZATION] submits. 
THE COURT:
Anything by the [ORGANIZATION]?  
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
No. 
THE COURT:
Submitted?  
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
I would submit. 
MS. [PARTY_NAME]:
The [ORGANIZATION] submits.
THE COURT:
The [ORGANIZATION] finds probable cause as 
charged.  The [ORGANIZATION] denies the Motion to 
Suppress Evidence.  I will note an objection 
on behalf of the [ORGANIZATION] to the [ORGANIZATION]'s 
ruling.
