CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED MEMORANDUM

TO:     Shenelle A. Washington, Esq.
FROM:   Associate Research Team
DATE:   February 1, 2024
RE:     Legal Analysis — Breach of Contract and Fraud Claims
        Westbrook Construction LLC v. Harmon Property Group Inc.
        Case No. 24-CV-01134, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum analyzes the breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation 
claims arising from a construction contract dispute between Westbrook Construction 
LLC ("Westbrook") and Harmon Property Group Inc. ("Harmon"). Based on our review 
of the contract documents, correspondence, and financial records, we believe 
Westbrook has strong claims on both theories.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On April 12, 2023, Westbrook and Harmon entered into a General Construction 
Agreement ("Contract") for the renovation of a commercial property located at 
8800 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611. The Contract price was 
$2,400,000, with a completion deadline of October 31, 2023.

Harmon paid an initial deposit of $480,000 (20% of contract price) on April 15, 
2023. Westbrook commenced work on May 1, 2023 and substantially completed the 
project by the October 31, 2023 deadline.

Despite substantial completion, Harmon has refused to pay the outstanding balance 
of $1,920,000, claiming construction defects that Westbrook disputes. Internal 
Harmon emails obtained through discovery reveal that Harmon's CEO, Brandon T. 
Harmon III, directed staff to manufacture defect claims to avoid payment, stating 
in an email dated November 3, 2023: "Find me something wrong with this building 
or find another job."

III. BREACH OF CONTRACT ANALYSIS

Under Illinois law, a breach of contract claim requires: (1) the existence of a 
valid and enforceable contract; (2) performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach by 
the defendant; and (4) resulting damages. Gonzalez v. American Express Co., 
2019 IL App (1st) 180552.

A. Contract Validity
The April 12, 2023 General Construction Agreement is a valid written contract, 
signed by authorized representatives of both parties, supported by adequate 
consideration, and containing all material terms.

B. Westbrook's Performance
Project completion documentation, third-party inspection reports dated October 28, 
2023 and November 2, 2023, and Harmon's own internal communications confirm 
substantial completion by the contractual deadline.

C. Harmon's Breach
Harmon's refusal to tender the outstanding balance of $1,920,000 constitutes a 
clear breach of the payment obligations under Section 4.2 of the Contract.

D. Damages
Westbrook's damages include:
   - Outstanding contract balance:        $1,920,000
   - Interest at 5% per annum from 
     November 1, 2023:                       $16,000 (to date)
   - Attorney's fees (if fees clause 
     applies under Section 12.1):          $185,000 (estimated)
   TOTAL ESTIMATED DAMAGES:              $2,121,000

IV. FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION ANALYSIS

To establish fraudulent misrepresentation under Illinois law, Westbrook must prove: 
(1) a false statement of material fact; (2) known to be false by the party making 
it; (3) made with intent to induce reliance; (4) actual reliance; and (5) resulting 
damages. Doe v. Dilling, 228 Ill.2d 324 (2008).

The November 3, 2023 email from Brandon T. Harmon III constitutes direct evidence 
of intentional fabrication of defect claims. This email has been authenticated 
through Harmon's IT department records and corroborated by two former Harmon 
employees, Jennifer Reyes (SSN: 555-66-7777) and David Park, who have provided 
sworn affidavits dated January 15, 2024.

before any disclosure to opposing counsel.

V. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. File motion for summary judgment on breach of contract claim by March 15, 2024
2. Subpoena Harmon's financial records to establish ability to pay
3. Depose Brandon T. Harmon III no later than April 1, 2024
4. Consider filing motion for sanctions based on discovery misconduct
5. Evaluate punitive damages claim based on fraud evidence

VI. CONCLUSION

The evidence strongly supports both breach of contract and fraudulent 
misrepresentation claims. The November 3, 2023 email is particularly 
damaging to Harmon's position and should be the centerpiece of our 
litigation strategy.
